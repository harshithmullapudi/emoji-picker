/**
 * If you haven't used Express before, it's official
 * documentation can be found here:
 *
 * https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html
 *
 * You'll need to add two new routes:
 *
 * 1. POST route `/messages` that accepts and store messages.
 *
 *    Use some simple data store to store the messages, so
 *    that they can be retrieved with the next route.
 *
 * 2. GET route `/messages` that returns stored messages.
 *
 * You can start the server from command line as follows:
 *
 *     $ npm run task2:start
 *
 * You will need to restart the server after making changes
 * for them to reflect.
 *
 * You can check `tests/api.test.js` to see the criteria
 * that this API should satisfy.
 *
 * You can run all tests from the command line as follows:
 *
 *     $ npm run task2:test
